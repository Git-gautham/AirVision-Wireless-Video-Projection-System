# AirVision-Wireless-Video-Projection-System
Project Overview

This project implements a wireless video streaming system that allows laptops or mobile devices to send video directly to projectors or monitors without being restricted by cable length.

The source device compresses the video to minimize latency and quality loss.

The compressed video is transmitted wirelessly over Wi-Fi.

An FPGA prototype (PYNQ-Z2) equipped with a Wi-Fi module receives the stream, converts it into HDMI format, and outputs it to the projector.

This system offers flexibility, mobility, and reduced hardware dependency compared to traditional wired connections.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Components Used

PYNQ-Z2 FPGA Board

Wi-Fi Module (for wireless transmission)

HDMI Interface (FPGA to Projector)

Video Compression Algorithms (software-side)

Laptops / Mobile Devices as video sources

üéØ Objectives

Enable wireless video streaming to projectors with minimal latency.

Reduce dependence on long HDMI/VGA cables.

Prototype the system on FPGA for efficient real-time video handling.
